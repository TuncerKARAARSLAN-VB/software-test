# Diversity of Software Testing and Examination of Tools

## Introduction

Software testing is a critical part of software development processes. Testing processes are essential for enhancing the quality of software and improving user experience. This project focuses on the diversity of software testing and the examination of the tools used.

## Objective

The purpose of this study is to analyze software testing tools, delve into testing concepts, and implement the testing process of an application. The project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of testing processes and tools.

## Types of Software Testing

Below is a table that classifies the types of software testing:

| Test Class           | Test Type                     | Description                                                                               |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Static Testing**   | Code Review                   | Manual review of the code by the development team.                                       |
|                      | Static Code Analysis          | Automated analysis of the code using tools (e.g., SonarQube).                          |
|                      | Document Review               | Examination of documents such as software requirement specifications and test plans.    |
|                      | Execution Analysis            | Analyses that examine what the code is rather than how it works.                       |
| **Dynamic Testing**  | Unit Testing                  | Testing of the smallest code units (typically functions or methods).                    |
|                      | Integration Testing           | Testing how multiple components work together.                                          |
|                      | System Testing                | Testing the system as a whole by integrating all components.                            |
|                      | Acceptance Testing            | Checking whether user requirements have been met.                                       |
|                      | Functional Testing            | Testing whether the software functions correctly.                                        |
|                      | Performance Testing           | Testing performance characteristics such as speed, response time, and resource usage.   |
|                      | Load Testing                  | Testing the behavior of the software under a specific load.                             |
|                      | Stress Testing                | Tests conducted to see how the system behaves when limits are exceeded.                 |
|                      | Security Testing              | Testing for vulnerabilities and the software's resilience against attacks.              |
| **Other Test Types** | Regression Testing            | Testing to ensure the system still works correctly after a new change.                  |
|                      | Black Box Testing             | Testing without knowledge of the internal structure of the system, only inputs and outputs are tested. |
|                      | White Box Testing             | Tests conducted with knowledge of the internal structure of the system.                 |
|                      | Usability Testing             | Testing user experience and usability.                                                  |
|                      | Beta Testing                  | A test type where end users provide feedback while using the product.                   |

This table summarizes the different types of software testing and the purpose and content of each test type. The test types are used at specific stages to enhance the quality of the software development process.
